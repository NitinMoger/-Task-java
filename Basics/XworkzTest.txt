1)Java is object oriented high level Programing langauge. Java is used to build applications. Java is platform independent.

2)JDK: jdk is stand for Java Development Kit. It is used to develop the java programe and it holds the java libraries and packages.
  JRE: jre stand for Java Runtime Environment. It is used to Exicute the java programe after the compilation will done.
  JVM:Jvm stand for Java Vertutal Machine .It is helps to convert the source code into byte code. And its also help to compile the java files.

3).java files are where you write your code, . class files are bytecode exicuting from the compilation of . java files by javac.

4)net beans,My eclipse,notepad++,visual studio.

5)Variable is type of container is holds to Store the information or values. 
  Types of variable is: Class varaible And Method variable.
   In Class variable there are 2types:- 1.static variable and 2.non static variable.
   In Method variable there are 2 types:- 1.local variable and 2. Instance variable. 
   Syntax: datatype Varaiblename = value;
   Ex:  String name= "X-Workz";
       System.out.println("Name is:"+name);

6) Object  is a Instance of class Java is Object oriented programming languages. we use new keyword to create a object. it supports all the principle of java it means its supports polymorphism,abstraction,encapsulation,inheritance.

7)Compilation Error. Because one class does't contain the  more than one main class.

8)Data type show the size and type of the variables. So jvm is easily understand the which type of variable it is.
  Data type is store the different values of the variable.  
  Types of Data type:- primitive Data type and non primitive data type.
  In primitive data type:- byte,short,int,float,char,boolean,double.
  In non primitive data type:- String, Array,class.
ex:- int age;
     String name;
     double cost;

9) dot operator is used to access the values.
  ex:-class Array{
       static int age;
       
      static void setStarter(int age)
       {
            this.age=age;
           System.out.println("Age is:"+age);
       }
     main method,........

10)*)Secure.
   *)Simple.
   *)Platform Independent.
   *)multi threading.
   *)Garbage collection.

11)Array is the collection of elements with same data type. It store the multiple values. Array have index values. The index values is start from the 0 and end with n-1. Array having the values inside the flower brackets.
   Array have a different types. 1)Single dimension array.
                                 2) Multi dimension aray.
  Syntax:  datatype variablename={vales};
  ex: String[] name={"Shambhu","Nitin","Veekshita","Karthik"};

12)Class:-class is a logical template to create a object. Class is also a blue print of the object.
   ex:-  class Array{
          //Block of code.....
           }
    Object:-Object is instance of class. object is have a state and behaviour.object is declared inside the class or method.new Keyword is used to create a object.
    ex:-  class Array{
              int age;
           
13) keywords are the reserved words.It can not be changed by the developers. Keyword is already built in java packages.
    10 keywords are:
    int,float,double.this,char,if,void,class,break,else,for,public private.

   ex:- class Array{
	
                static int id;
                static String name;
                static int[] val={10,20,30,40,50,60};
	        static  void setStarter(int id,String name)
		  {
			  id=id;
			  name=name;
			  System.out.println("id, name:" +id+ ","+name);
			  
		  }
	    
        public static void main(String[] args)
        {
	   System.out.println("Strt");
	   for (int i=val.length-1;i>=0;i--)
		  {
			System.out.println("Array values are:"+val[i]);  
		  }
		  setStarter(12,"Shambhu");
	  }
         }
14) Constructor is same as method but it bit special to compare to method. 
    Constructor is used to create a instance variables.
    Constructor name and class name as always same.
    Constructor has no return type.
     Types of Constructor
     1)default constructor:-It is adefault constructor and it is created by Jvm.default constructor is always have a defualt values.  
     2)Parametarised constructor:- Parametarised constructor is created by he Developer. we create a infinite parameterised constructor of different parameters. 
     3) copy constructor:-copy constructor means we use to create one object to initialize another object in the same instance of class.
  ex:-
class Array{
	
  int id;
  String name;
Array()
{
System.out.println("constructor having no arguments");
}
	  
Array(int id,String name)
		  {
			  this.id=id;
			  this.name=name;
			  
		  }
	    
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
	   System.out.println("Strt");
           Array nitin=new Array(12,"x workz");
           System.out.println("id is:+nitin.id); 
          System.out.println("name is:+nitin.name);		  
   }

}

15) The main() method is static so that JVM can invoke it without instantiating the class. This also saves the unnecessary wastage of memory. which is used by the object declared only for calling the main() method by the JVM.
 TYpes of method:- static method and non static method.

16)class Array{

    public static void main(String[] args)
   {
      int[] val={12,3,2,45,6,7,6};
      System.out.println("The Array value is:"+val[5]);
      for(int i=0;i>val.length;,i++)
      {
         System.out.println("array is:"+val[i]); 
       }
    }
}

    
17)Method:-method is block of code and it performs some task.

 Method Overloading :-if a class has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters, it is known as Method Overloading.
  ex:-  class Adder{  
    static int add(int a,int b)
    {
     return a+b;
    }   
    static int add(int a,int b,int c)
    {
       return a+b+c;
     }  
    }  
   class TestOverloading1{  
   public static void main(String[] args){  
   System.out.println(Adder.add(11,11));  
   System.out.println(Adder.add(11,11,11));  
   }
}
